  # The content is a TOSCA encoding of selected SID information model entities as explained in IG1176
    namespace_prefix: sid

# This file is built on the following assumptions:
# A wireless connection is created by the 5G network in the admin down state and changed by the network to admin up when a connection request is made by a SIM. 
#     i.e. standard behavior which does not need to modelled in this TOSCA template
# The change over from fixed connection to a wireless connection is under control of the charging station.
# One slice is used for all wireless connections
# The slice will be allocated additional resources by the CSP in anticipation of a storm or other at-risk event
# The additional resources are provided only for some sub-set of the charging stations
# The sub-set of affected charging stations may change over time
