  # data types to implement SID MetricABE
  ####################

  # MetricABE is represented as a data type schema not a node type because the orchestrator is not required to instantiate Metric ABE entities (as it is for resource entities)
  # The disadvantages are that 
  # a) the MetricABE relationships are reduced to a single complex schema so the associations can only be navigated a a single tree. Flattening the associations to create the tree is a decision made when creating sid.yml
  # b) one the schema is used as an attribute everything inside it is a TOSCA attribute (and so read only) - may not be true consider how some SID attributes could eb properties and others attributes
  # c) None of the values are available until run time.
  # TODO How can this be expanded to include thresholds and consequences which can be read at design time? May need TOSCA spec changes to do this cleanly

    # 2 use requirements: - dependency: capability
