    # There are four approaches to import the JSON schemas for GST into TOSCA. Approach 3 is recommended

  # Approach 1 is to convert the JSON schema into YAML (which can be done by a utility filter e.g. https://jsonformatter.org/json-to-yaml)
  # and then process the result to be TOSCA
  # This exposes the properties within each GST group so that they can be used in the TOSCA template
  # but any JSON definition of mandatory parameters is lost unless handled manually
  # Here is an example
  
  # Delete the line "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
  # delete title string and make title value the name of the data type adding a colon
  # title: "1-WHO" 
  1-WHO:
    # retain description from JSON to YAML conversion and indent it
    description: "1-WHO"
    #delete the object type line
    #type: object
    properties: 
    # indent and remove quotes from properties
    #"CustomerName/Reference": 
      CustomerName/Reference: 
        # retain description
        description: "Customer name or reference"
        # retain type assuming it is string, boolean which are the only types currently used (others may be possible)
        type: string
        # convert any format clause to a TOSCA constraint element
        # Currently there is only one format used in the schema. Translation would be better if the JSON schema was re-defined to be type dateYAML timestamp 
        # convert any enum clause to a TOSCA valid_values constraint element
      # JSON and the converted YAML has a 'required' field in the data type definition of the group but TOSCA only allows 'required: true' when the data type is used. 
      # So as a work around if the JSON schema required field is not null then each property in the schema required by field must have a constraint element added in the TOSCA property definition
      # required: Here is an example but it it not needed in any current gst json schemas
      #constraint:
        #pattern: "(.+)" # must be something; cannot be nothing


  # Approach 2 is to refer use the TOSCA schema keyword to signal to the orchestrator that the data value can be validated at run time using the referenced schema
  # This is OK of the TOSCA template does not need to get the value of any property inside the GST group.
  # Here is an example

  2-WHAT:
    description: "2-WHAT"
    derived_from: string
    constraints:
      # The first schema keyword is TOSCA, the string withing the braces is JSON and includes a schema keyword so that we can refer to a URI rather than copying the JSON in line
      - schema: { "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5g-ridersonthestorm/gsma-gst/master/gst/json-schema/2-what.json#" }

  # Approach 3 is to use a JSON pointer in the TOSCA constraint schema clause to target the particular part of the JSON schema relevant to the TOSCA datatype
  # The orchestrator would need to support JSON pointers to perform validation
  # as would any TOSCA based data entry form
  # Here is an example (shown for Area, the only constrained parameter in 3-WHERE)

  3-WHERE:

    properties:
      LocationScope:
        description: Scope of location

      Location:

        type: string
      Area:
        description: Polygon of <Lat,Long> coordinates representing the area

        constraints:
        - schema: { "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5g-ridersonthestorm/gsma-gst/master/gst/json-schema/3-where.json#/properties/Area" }

      AreaSize(SqKm):
        description: Needs to be calculated by some means, e.g. user creates a polygon on the UI to derive result,  enter a set of region/city/suburb names/postcodes and leverage GIS to derive result, etc.
        type: string
      ConnectionDensity(Ue/SqKm):

        type: string
      AvailableCellularFrequencyBands:
        description: This is informational.  If customer selects a given area, this would scope the frequency bands that are relevant in that area.  This  can be used as a feed-forward filter for d
        type: string

  
  # Approach 4 is to modify the content of gst/json-schema so that each row of the GST has its own JSON schema and then use approach 1 or 2 on that. 
  # The GST JSON schema could still also have schemas for the groups as well
  # No example i shown as this is more work, requires changes outside TOSCA and has no advantage over approach 3.
